Productivity and Variance Calculator (PVC)
In a target-based company, employees earn 100 productivity points for every hour worked. The total productivity points for an employee in a week are calculated as:

Total Productivity Points
=
Number of Hours Worked
×
100
To achieve optimal productivity, an employee's weekly productivity must be at least 100%.
